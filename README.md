# Smart-Customer-Segmentation
In this project, I leveraged K-Means clustering to segment customers based on recency, frequency, and monetary (RFM) value, enabling data-driven marketing strategies and personalized customer engagement. By analyzing historical transaction data, I identified distinct customer groups, allowing the business to differentiate between high-value, loyal customers and at-risk segments.

This segmentation model empowered the marketing team to implement targeted retention campaigns, personalized promotions, and loyalty programs, resulting in higher customer engagement and improved conversion rates. Additionally, it optimized resource allocation in marketing spend, ensuring a higher ROI on customer acquisition and retention efforts. The insights derived from this model directly contributed to increased customer lifetime value (CLV), reduced churn, and improved overall profitability.

The project was executed using Python, Pandas, and Scikit-Learn, with data visualization in Power BI to facilitate strategic decision-making.
